MapStruct 1.1.0.CR1 consolodates the functionality introduced in the preceeding MapStruct 1.1.0 Beta releases. A number of bugs were solved:

* Automatic generation of an iterable mapping methods where the property selection is based on a qualfier.
* Collection source getter null check to avoid NullPointExceptions.
* Missing imports for generic types in collections in generated methods.
* Removing redundant code from generated code when using nested source properties.
* Optimisation when using enum constant (using an enum constant instead of a String conversion).
* Fixing order for dependsOn.
* Fixing an issue introduced 1.1.0.Beta2 that causes problems for the @MappingTarget in combination with @InheritInverseConfiguration
