The MapStruct code base is thoroughly documented via JavaDoc. You can find the latest docs [here](https://mapstruct.ci.cloudbees.com/job/mapstruct-javadoc/javadoc/). The individual pages contain generated class diagrams showing type hierarchies and package contents.

To get yourself acquainted with the code base, you could start by taking a look at the docs of [MappingProcessor](https://mapstruct.ci.cloudbees.com/job/mapstruct-javadoc/javadoc/index.html?org/mapstruct/ap/MappingProcessor.html) which give a high-level overview of the general architecture. Then check out the [org.mapstruct.ap.model](https://mapstruct.ci.cloudbees.com/job/mapstruct-javadoc/javadoc/index.html?org/mapstruct/ap/model/package-summary.html) and [org.mapstruct.ap.processor](https://mapstruct.ci.cloudbees.com/job/mapstruct-javadoc/javadoc/index.html?org/mapstruct/ap/processor/package-summary.html) packages.

If you have any questions don't hesitate [to ask](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/mapstruct-users), we are here to help!
